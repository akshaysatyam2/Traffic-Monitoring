# ðŸš¦ Traffic Monitoring Project: Automated Traffic Management ðŸš¦

This project aims to **automate traffic management** by detecting, tracking, and extracting vehicle registration numbers from video feeds provided by traffic cameras. It builds upon pre-existing systems used by various organizations, while introducing improvements for efficiency and automation.

Using **YOLOv8** for object detection and **SORT** for object tracking, the project automates the process of monitoring road traffic. Additionally, it extracts vehicle registration numbers through **EasyOCR**, supporting multiple license plate formats, including **HSRP** (High-Security Registration Plates).

## ðŸ›‚ Registration Number Extractor

The project automates the extraction of vehicle registration numbers by detecting license plates using **YOLOv8** and reading the numbers using **EasyOCR**. It supports various license plate formats, including **HSRP**, without requiring a specific standard for successful detection.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

The following technologies are utilized to automate traffic management:

- **YOLOv8**: Object detection (vehicles, license plates, etc.).
- **SORT**: Object tracking to maintain continuous monitoring.
- **EasyOCR**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for reading text from the detected license plates.
