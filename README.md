# Traffic Monitoring Project

## Overview
This project uses YOLOv8 for object detection and SORT tracker for object tracking to monitor road traffic via video feeds from traffic cameras.

## Features
- **Object Detection:** Accurate vehicle detection with YOLOv8.
- **Object Tracking:** Efficient vehicle tracking using SORT.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Add OCR for vehicle registration numbers.
  - Automate monitoring with additional metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
